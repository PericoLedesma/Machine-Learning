# Machine Learning: Models evaluation for Handwritten Digits Recognition

## Learning outcomes

1) understand and appreciate universal challenges that arise in (almost) every machine learning (ML) project: curse of dimensionality, bias-variance tradeoff, choice of loss function, architecture design (structural bias), and know about standard coping strategies (dimension Reduction, regularization, cross-validation) 
2) give a coarse overview of the rich landscape of modern ML (supervised / unsupervised / reinforcement learning, 
different modeling attitudes, goals and methods in different subfields of ML) 
3) understand basic algorithmic techniques that is sufficient to allow him/her to practically apply these techniques by programming from scratch or using a high-level toolbox 
4) easily and quickly implement simple (but not necessarily poorly performing) linear, baseline ML pipelines for supervised learning problems 
5) design, implement, run, test and evaluate a more complex, multi-module, nonlinear ML pipeline for supervised learning problems, possibly including unsupervised components
